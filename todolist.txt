1. Forward Processing
DONE

All in ARIESRecoveryManager.java

a. Transaction Status
    -commit()
    DONE
    -abort()
    DONE
    -end()
    DONE
b. Logging
    -logPageWrite()
    DONE
c. Savepoints
    -rollbackToSavepoint()
    DONE
d. Checkpoints
    -checkpoint()
    DONE



2. Restart Recovery

All in ARIESRecoveryManager.java

- restart()
- restartAnalysis(): 
    Left with testRestartAnalysis()
- restartRedo() : testRestartRedo() passes but function still conceptually a bit wrong
    * Added helper function redoTheLogRecord() to be iterated per log record.
    * Added check for situations when we don't undo [DONE]
	* page in DPT [DONE]
	* LSN not less than recLSN of page [DONE]
	* pageLSN on page is strictly less than LSN of record [DONE]
    * Add updating of pageLSN to LSN value [NOT DONE] 
	(need to fix case where !logRecord.getPageNum().isPresent())
- restartUndo()

3. Tying it All Up

In Database.java, subClass TransactionImpl
(Database::TransactionImpl)

- startCommit()
(This is just removing a line of code and replacing it with the commented code, and sets up the database to use recovery.)
