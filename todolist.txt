    DONE
    -abort()
    DONE
    -end()
    DONE
b. Logging
    -logPageWrite()

2. Restart Recovery

All in ARIESRecoveryManager.java

- restart()
- restartAnalysis()
- restartRedo()
- restartUndo()

3. Tying it All Up

In Database.java, subClass TransactionImpl
(Database::TransactionImpl)

- startCommit()
(This is just removing a line of code and replacing it with the commented code, and sets up the database to use recovery.)
